<br />

Hello! Welcome to a real time **COVID-19** tracker made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/ "Flutter"). I started this project by watching the original step by step designing of *[Flutter Way](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJm7i4g4z7ZGcJA_HKHLCVw "Flutter Way")*, but as I ended watching the original video, I was able to find some inconsistencies into the code (unresponsive scales, for instance). Then I decided to make this project, by following these steps:

1. Code Along with de original video tutorial. âœ”
2. Fix some of the design inconsistencies. ðŸ•˜ (*Half-Made*)
3. Get real data by using some API. âœ”

For this third step, I used an free API that I found on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/ "RapidAPI"),  that is called (*surprisingly*) [COVID-19 API](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193/details "COVID-19 API"), by [API Sports](https://rapidapi.com/user/api-sports "API Sports").
